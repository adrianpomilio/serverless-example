# AWS requirements
Because we are working with AWS you will need to take these AWS specific steps.


## AWS Account
Create an AWS account, they have a free tier but will require you to enter a credit card.  

1. Visit [AWS Free Account ] : https://aws.amazon.com/free/
2. Follow the account setup process from their site

## Create an IAM user

1. Visit [AWS Creating an IAM user]:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html
2. Follow the official documentation steps for creating the user
3. Attach an Administrator policy to the IAM user
4. Download the IAM account credentials and keep them in a safe place, do not deploy these or put in version control (for now).
5. Add the credentials to your ~/.aws/credentials file  (you can create this directory and file if they do not already exist)

>For these examples all you will need is a IAM user account that you attach and Administrator policy to.  In production environments you will want a more elaborate setup.

## Install the AWS CLI
You will need this tool to be able to interact with AWS via the command line, or to run scripts to automate your processes.

1. Visit [AWS CLI]:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
2. Follow the official documentation steps for your specific system
